# Sentimental-Analysis-of-Airline-Reviews-using-R

### Introduction
This project was done as a part of my coursework and I along with my team performed Sentimental Analysis of US Airline Reviews using R 
to evaluate the customer tweet sentiment by airline and how it evolves over a week. The airlines under consideration for evaluation were 
American, Delta, Southwest Airlines, United, US Airways, and Virgin America.

The data is a collection of 14640 tweets tagged with positive, negative and neutral sentiments and is fetched from Kaggle from the link-
https://www.kaggle.com/crowdflower/twitter-airline-sentiment

Based on our analysis, below are the findings that we observed: 
* Most tweets have negative sentiment (>60%).
* Most tweets are targeted towards United airlines, followed by American and US Airways.
* Virgin receives very few tweets. 
* Main reasons for negative sentiment are Customer Service Issues and Late Flights.
* Negative sentiment tweets towards Delta are based mostly on late flights and not so much on Customer Service Issues as for the rest of the airlines.
* Most tweets are not retweeted.
* Most tweets come from the States.
* Most of the tweets targeted towards American, United and US Airways contain negative sentiment. 
* Tweets targeted towards Delta, Virgin and Southwest containing roughly same proportion of negative, neutral and positive sentiment.
